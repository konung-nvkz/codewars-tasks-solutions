/*Minimum to multiple
DESCRIPTION:
Given two integers a and x, return the minimum non-negative number to add to / subtract from a to make it a multiple of x.

minimum(10, 6)  //= 2

10+2 = 12 which is a multiple of 6
Note
0 is always a multiple of x
Constraints
1 <= a <= 106

1 <= x <= 105
*/
function minimum(a, x) {
    if (a%x < x/2) {
        return a%x;
    } else {
        return x-a%x
    }
}
console.log(minimum(10, 6)); //2
console.log(minimum(13, 6)); //1
console.log(minimum(12, 6)); //0

function minimum(a, x) {
    return (a%x < x/2)? a%x : x-a%x;
